Webhooks
*********

Webhooks are an essential mechanism for integrating your Django Payments
application with external payment gateways like Stripe, PayPal, or Braintree.
They allow real-time event notifications to be sent to your application without
requiring continuous polling or manual API requests. With webhooks, your
application stays synchronized with payment gateway updates, such as successful
payments, subscription status changes, or refunds.

In the context of Django Payments, webhooks enable payment gateways to send
event notifications directly to your Django application. By configuring the
payment gateway to send these notifications to a specific URL endpoint in your
application, you can create a webhook handler to process these events. This
lets you update your internal state, trigger relevant actions, or send user
notifications based on payment-related events.

URL Structure
=============

The webhook URL structure in django-payments follows this pattern::

   {protocol}://{host}/payments/process/{variant}/

Where:

- ``{protocol}``: Defined in ``PAYMENT_PROTOCOL`` (typically "http" or "https").
- ``{host}``: Defined in ``PAYMENT_HOST``.
- ``{variant}``: The payment provider name as configured in ``PAYMENT_VARIANTS``.

For example, with this configuration:

.. code-block:: python

   PAYMENT_VARIANTS = {
       'stripe': (  # <-- This is your variant name
           'payments.stripe.StripeProviderV3',
           {
               'api_key': 'sk_test_123456',
               'use_token': True,
               'endpoint_secret': 'whsec_123456',
               'secure_endpoint': True
           }
       )
   }

   PAYMENT_HOST = 'your-app.com'
   PAYMENT_PROTOCOL = 'https'

Your webhook URL would be::

   https://your-app.com/payments/process/stripe/

.. note::

   Ensure the URL matches exactly, including the trailing slash. A common cause
   of 404 errors is an incorrect URL pattern or a missing trailing slash.

Stripe Webhooks
===============

Setting up Webhooks in Stripe
-----------------------------

To receive real-time payment notifications from Stripe, follow these steps:

#. Log in to your `Stripe Dashboard <https://dashboard.stripe.com/>`_.
#. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Developers** â†’ **Webhooks**.
#. Click **+ Add endpoint** to create a new webhook listener.
#. Enter the webhook URL in the "Endpoint URL" field. The URL should follow the
   format::

      https://your-app.com/payments/process/{variant}/

   where ``{variant}`` is the name configured in ``PAYMENT_VARIANTS``.
   Example: ``https://your-app.com/payments/process/stripe/``

#. Select the events you want to receive notifications for. At a minimum,
   include these:

   - ``checkout.session.async_payment_failed``
   - ``checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded``
   - ``checkout.session.completed``
   - ``checkout.session.expired``

#. Click **Add endpoint** to save the webhook configuration.
#. Copy the **Signing secret** provided by Stripe. You will need this to verify
   webhook authenticity in your Django application.
#. Test the webhook by sending a test event using Stripe's **Send test
   webhook** feature.

Testing Webhooks Locally
------------------------

During development, you can use the `Stripe CLI
<https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install>`_ to test webhooks by forwarding
Stripe events to your local server.

#. Install the Stripe CLI and log in:

   .. code-block:: bash

      stripe login

#. Start listening for events and forward them to your local server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/payments/process/stripe/ \
         -e checkout.session.async_payment_failed,checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded,checkout.session.completed,checkout.session.expired

#. In another terminal, trigger test events:

   .. code-block:: bash

      stripe trigger checkout.session.completed

Alternative Webhook Testing Tools
---------------------------------

Apart from Stripe's built-in tools, you can test your webhooks using external
services:

- `Beeceptor <https://beeceptor.com/>`_: A free webhook testing tool that
  allows you to inspect and debug webhook requests before integrating them into
  your application.
- `RequestBin by Pipedream <https://pipedream.com/requestbin>`_: Provides a
  public or private endpoint where you can inspect incoming webhook requests in
  real-time.

These tools can be useful for verifying request payloads and debugging webhook
events outside of your local development environment.

Security Best Practices
-----------------------

.. note::

   Always validate incoming webhook requests to ensure they originate from
   Stripe. Use the signing secret to verify authenticity before processing any
   event.

.. warning::

   Ensure ``PAYMENT_HOST`` and ``PAYMENT_PROTOCOL`` are correctly set in your
   Django settings. If they are misconfigured, webhooks will not work as
   expected.
